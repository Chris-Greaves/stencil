# stencil

## Ideas

### CLI

The CLI is what will be used by most, and will give the ability to pull down templates and create projects from them.

- Ability to build projects from templates just like CookieCutter
- Ability to have optional settings
- Ability to create a temp web server to host a user friendly webpage to enter settings
    - When submitted on the webpage, it should create the project and shutdown the web server.

### Website

This website will hold a collection of known templates that can be easily pulled down using a much smaller name. (Like Docker Hub)

- Ability to select the settings on the webpage and get given a like to pass into the stencil CLI to create the project.
    - Link will only work for 10 mins before being deleted.

### Extension

This will be an extension to Visual Studio Code, and will allow users to use stencil without needing to use the CLI.

- Users can enter the settings they want, within visual studio.
